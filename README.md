# CSE305 Project
## A parallelized sequence alignment implementation

### Roadmap of implementation

1. We would like to begin by implementing the Myers-Miller sequence alignment algorithm which has a linear space complexity and quadratic time complexity. Implementing the non-parallelized algorithm can help us understand the problem better.
2. We would then like to implement the parallelized algorithm presented in the referenced by Rajko and Aluru 2004.
