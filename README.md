## A parallelized sequence alignment implementation

### Roadmap of implementation

1. We would like to begin by implementing the Myers-Miller sequence alignment algorithm which has a linear space complexity and quadratic time complexity. Implementing the non-parallelized algorithm can help us understand the problem better.
2. We would then like to implement the parallelized algorithm presented in the referenced by Rajko and Aluru 2004. 
3. Finally, we would like to end by comparing the performance (time) of the parallel implementation vs the non-parallel one based on the number of threads. 
4. If we have time, we would possibly like to explore other algorithms such as Smith-Waterman and analyze its performance.
